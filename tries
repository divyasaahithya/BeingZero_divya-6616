1. Introduction to TRIE Advanced Data Structure  
A TRIE (prefix tree) is used for efficient string storage and retrieval. 
A TRIE (pronounced as "try") is a tree-based data structure used for efficient storage, retrieval, and searching of strings, particularly in dictionary and autocomplete applications
It is also known as a prefix tree because it stores words by breaking them into individual characters along a path, ensuring that common prefixes are shared among multiple words.

Key Features of TRIE:  
1. Efficient Storage – Words sharing common prefixes use the same initial paths, reducing redundant storage.  
2. Fast Lookup – Searching for a word takes O(M) time, where M is the length of the word.  
3. Autocomplete Support – TRIE efficiently suggests words based on a given prefix.  
4. Prefix Searching – Allows searching for all words with a given prefix in optimal time.  
5. Dictionary Implementation – Useful in spell checkers, IP routing, and natural language processing.  

Structure of a TRIE Node:  
Each node in a TRIE contains:  
- A fixed array (or HashMap) of child nodes, typically of size 26 for lowercase English letters.  
- A flag to mark the end of a valid word.  


2. Important Operations on TRIE  
- Insert(word) → Adds a word to the trie.  
- Search(word) → Checks if a word exists in the trie.  
- StartsWith(prefix) → Returns words starting with a given prefix.  


3. Complexity Analysis for Storing Large Amounts of Words  
| Data Structure | Insert/Search Complexity |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Array          | O(n)                     |
| Linked List    | O(n)                     |
| BST            | O(log n)                 |
| TRIE           | O(m) (m = word length)   |


4. How to Use TRIE as a Map?  
- Store key-value pairs where keys are strings.  
- Use trie nodes to store values at end nodes.  


5. Real-World Applications of TRIE  
- Auto-suggest in search engines  
- Spell checkers  
- IP routing tables  
- Dictionary implementations
